# PackApi
Wrapper around Hipex hosting platform API. Have a look at https://www.hipex.io/. The better part of this library
is generated from the File generated from [https://service.hipex.io/hipex-pack-api](https://service.hipex.io/hipex-pack-api) GraphQL endpoint.

For a more extended documentation and API explorer please check out [https://service.hipex.io/hipex-pack-api/docs/](https://service.hipex.io/hipex-pack-api/docs/).

## Usage
On first usage a login is required. This will store a token in your home directory (~/.hipex-console-auth) or if set a token file provided.
After login you can call the queries and mutations. When calling queries without login first the API will just return without result or on mutations throw an exception.

**Login**
```php
$client = new \HipexPackApi\Client();
$client->login('info@example.com', 'password');
```

**Call query / mutation**
In this example we will fetch a list of all servers and for each server we will fetch the domains on the server. There is a much more efficient way
of making the same API call in GraphQL without using the API wrapper. For this have a look at the extended API documentation.
```php
$servers = $client->queryServer();
foreach ($servers as $server) {
    $filter = new \HipexPackApi\Generated\Schema\Input\FilterInput();
    $filter->setField('server.id');
    $filter->value($server->getId());
    
    $domains = $client->queryDomain($filter);    
} 
```

**Running GraphQL Query**
```php
$query = '
query Server {
    Server {
        id
        name
        domains {
            id
            domain
            letsEncryptSsl
            backup
        }
    }
}
';
$serversAndDomains = $client->raw($query); 
```
